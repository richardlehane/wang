Acquisition of a CD-ROM player and two commercial bibliographic databases has improved considerably efficiency in acquisition work and reference services.\f0\fs60 PARTIALLY:  The lack of the mainframe connection for the PS/2-60 (CS88/078) and missing mouse caused difficulties in the work of Reference librarians.\f0\fs60 NO:   Reason ...\f0\fs60 1\f0\fs60   We would be grateful if you could check the actual column\f0\fs60       and correct as necessary.\f0\fs60 CMC MANAGEMENT REPORTING 1988\f0\fs60 Attachment 3\f0\fs60 FOR  LIBRARY SERVICES\f0\fs60 V.\f0\fs60 General Comments on Computer Services\f0\fs60 In general services provided by the Computer Section were good.\f0\fs60 It should be admitted that the Central computer possibility to access external databases and EARNET is highly appreciated.\f0\fs60 We appreciate very much the CS's decision to implement the IBM Cabling Scheme in the VIC Library which we believe will be mutually beneficial provided a high level of flexibility in connecting of computer workstations and will eliminate connection delays.\f0\fs60 The Office Automation Project, which the Library joined in February, has a great support and we expect to have further benefits of computerization.\f0\fs60 The HELP Center courses attended by Library staff were useful and efficient.\f0\fs60 The Global computer applications menu is a very good idea which improves considerably the VIC staff awareness about information resources available in the Central computer.\f0\fs60 Some problems:\f0\fs60 -The problems with VSAM datasets and disk head crashes, created serious problems for library services including loses of data.\f0\fs60 -The mainframe response sometimes is poor and creates inconveniences in Library services/staff work.\f0\fs60 -We experience problems with use of TSO/SCRIPT, the old\f0\fs60  setup does not work anymore since the 4-th quarter of 1988,\f0\fs60  there were no adequate instructions received on a use of new\f0\fs60  version of SCRIPT.\f0\fs60 -Delays in delivery of some components for PS/2s received \f0\fs60  caused some inconveniences in the work (mouse, manuals)\f0\fs60  \f0\fs60 Suggestions:\f0\fs60 We suggest that the Computer Section should consider a \f0\fs60  possibility to conduct on the regular basis USER MEETINGS (e.g. \f0\fs60  in one of Conference rooms in C07) in order to:\f0\fs60 -Inform users about general trends in computerization and \f0\fs60   \f0\fs60  \f0\fs60  steps/programs launched in the CS;\f0\fs60 -Recent news in in-house computer services with comments, \f0\fs60   explanation of problems happened (if need)\f0\fs60 -To discuss with users their needs/suggestions, give answers on \f0\fs60  their questions (it will not substitude application planning \f0\fs60  \f0\fs60  meetings).}
