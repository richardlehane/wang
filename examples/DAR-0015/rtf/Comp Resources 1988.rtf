We believe it will be mutually beneficial by providing a high level of flexibility in connecting computer workstations and by eliminating connection delays.\line \line The Library is very enthusiastic about the Office Automation Project, which the Library joined in February. We feel that the CS is providing great support.  We look forward to its benefits of computerization.\line \line The HELP Center courses attended by Library staff were useful and well taught.\line \line The Global Computer Applications menu is a very good idea, improving considerably VIC staff awareness of information resources available through the Central Computer.\line \line ADS1/ISIS software developed by CS/UNIDO has opened new horizons for wide distribution of VIC Library information through the VIC in a user friendly way.  ADS1/ISIS is a powerful system, but its users need system documentation badly.\line \line Some problems:\line \line -The problems with VSAM datasets and disk head crashes created serious problems for library services including loses of data.\line \line -The mainframe response time sometimes is poor and creates inconveniences in Library services/staff work.\line \line -We experience problems with use of TSO/SCRIPT.  The old\line  setup has not worked since the 4-th quarter of 1988.\line  No adequate instructions were received on the use of the\line  new version of SCRIPT.\line \line -Delays in delivery of some components for the Library's PS/2s (mouse,\line manuals) caused some inconveniences.\line \line \line **Format string, line length: **69\line Suggestions:\line \line We suggest that the Computer Section consider conducting USER MEETINGS (e.g. in one of Conference rooms in C07) on a regular basis in order:\line \line -To inform users about general trends in computerization and\line  steps/programs launched in the CS;\line \line -To provide recent news of in-house computer services with comments,\line  explanation of problems encountered (if needed);\line \line -To discuss with users their needs/suggestions; to answer their\line  questions.
