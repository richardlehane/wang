Acquisition of a CD-ROM player and two commercial bibliographic databases has improved considerably efficiency in acquisition work and reference services.\f0\fs24 PARTIALLY:  Unfortunately, the lack of the mainframe connection for the PS/2-60 the PC (CS99/078) and the missing mouse caused difficulties in the work of the Reference librarians, forcing them to use workstations in other Library offices.\f0\fs24 NO:   Reason ...\f0\fs24 1\f0\fs24   We would be grateful if you could check the actual column\f0\fs24       and correct as necessary.\f0\fs24 CMC MANAGEMENT REPORTING 1988\f0\fs24 Attachment 3\f0\fs24 FOR  LIBRARY SERVICES{\b \f0\fs24 V.\f0\fs24 General Comments on Computer Services}\f0\fs24 In general services provided by the Computer Section were good.\f0\fs24 The facility to access external databases and EARNET through the central computer is highly appreciated.\f0\fs24 We appreciate very much the CS's decision to implement the IBM Cabling Scheme in the VIC Library.  We believe it will be mutually beneficial by providing a high level of flexibility in connecting computer workstations and by eliminating connection delays.\f0\fs24 The Library is very enthusiastic about the Office Automation Project, which the Library joined in February. We feel that the CS is providing great support.  We look forward to its benefits of computerization.\f0\fs24 The HELP Center courses attended by Library staff were useful and well taught.\f0\fs24 The Global Computer Applications menu is a very good idea, improving considerably VIC staff awareness of information resources available through the Central Computer.\f0\fs24 ADS1/ISIS software developed by CS/UNIDO has opened new horizons for wide distribution of VIC Library information through the VIC in a user friendly way.  ADS1/ISIS is a powerful system, but its users need system documentation badly.\f0\fs24 Some problems:\f0\fs24 -The problems with VSAM datasets and disk head crashes created serious problems for library services including loses of data.\f0\fs24 -The mainframe response time sometimes is poor and creates inconveniences in Library services/staff work.\f0\fs24 -We experience problems with use of TSO/SCRIPT.  The old\f0\fs24  setup has not worked since the 4-th quarter of 1988.\f0\fs24  No adequate instructions were received on the use of the\f0\fs24  new version of SCRIPT.\f0\fs24 -Delays in delivery of some components for the Library's PS/2s (mouse,\f0\fs24 manuals) caused some inconveniences.\f0\fs24 Suggestions:\f0\fs24 We suggest that the Computer Section consider conducting USER MEETINGS (e.g. in one of Conference rooms in C07) on a regular basis in order:\f0\fs24 -To inform users about general trends in computerization and\f0\fs24  steps/programs launched in the CS;\f0\fs24 -To provide recent news of in-house computer services with comments,\f0\fs24  explanation of problems encountered (if needed);\f0\fs24 -To discuss with users their needs/suggestions; to answer their\f0\fs24  questions. (It is not intended as a substitute for application planning\f0\fs24  meetings).\f0\fs24 VBabichev/HGabbert/eh-2619(9900G)}
