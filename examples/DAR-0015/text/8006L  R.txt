IV.	Effectiveness of New Equipment

	Expectations MET:

		YES:  Improvement in the staff work effeciency, various routine activities are being computerized. Acquisition of a CD-ROM player and two commercial bibliographic databases has improved considerably efficiency in acquisition work and reference services.








		PARTIALLY:  The lack of the mainframe connection for the PS/2-60 (CS88/078) and missing mouse caused difficulties in the work of Reference librarians.











		NO:   Reason ...

V.	General Comments on Computer Services

	In general services provided by the Computer Section were good.

It should be admitted that the Central computer possibility to access external databases and EARNET is highly appreciated.

	We appreciate very much the CS's decision to implement the IBM Cabling Scheme in the VIC Library which we believe will be mutually beneficial provided a high level of flexibility in connecting of computer workstations and will eliminate connection delays.

	The Office Automation Project, which the Library joined in February, has a great support and we expect to have further benefits of computerization.

	The HELP Center courses attended by Library staff were useful and efficient.

	The Global computer applications menu is a very good idea which improves considerably the VIC staff awareness about information resources available in the Central computer.


	Some problems:

	-The problems with VSAM datasets and disk head crashes, created serious problems for library services including loses of data.

	-The mainframe response sometimes is poor and creates inconveniences in Library services/staff work.

	-We experience problems with use of TSO/SCRIPT, the old
	 setup does not work anymore since the 4-th quarter of 1988,
	 there were no adequate instructions received on a use of new
	 version of SCRIPT.

	
	-Delays in delivery of some components for PS/2s received 	 caused some inconveniences in the work (mouse, manuals)

 	Suggestions:

	We suggest that the Computer Section should consider a 	 possibility to conduct on the regular basis USER MEETINGS (e.g. 	 in one of Conference rooms in C07) in order to:
	
	-Inform users about general trends in computerization and 	  	 	 steps/programs launched in the CS;

	-Recent news in in-house computer services with comments, 	  explanation of problems happened (if need)

	-To discuss with users their needs/suggestions, give answers on 	 their questions (it will not substitude application planning 	 	 meetings).
