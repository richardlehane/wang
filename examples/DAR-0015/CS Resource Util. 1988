Acquisition of a CD-ROM player and two commercial bibliographic databases has improved considerably efficiency in acquisition work and reference services.PARTIALLY:  Unfortunately, the lack of the mainframe connection for the PS/2-60 the PC (CS99/078) and the missing mouse caused difficulties in the work of the Reference librarians, forcing them to use workstations in other Library offices.NO:   Reason ...1  We would be grateful if you could check the actual column      and correct as necessary.†1                                                                       1                                                                         CMC MANAGEMENT REPORTING 1988Attachment 3FOR  LIBRARY SERVICESV.Çåîåòáì Ãïííåîôó ïî Ãïíğõôåò Óåòöéãåó1                                                                     In general, services provided by the Computer Section were good.The facility to access external databases and EARNET through the central computer is highly appreciated.We appreciate very much the CS's decision to implement the IBM Cabling Scheme in the VIC Library.  We believe it will be mutually beneficial by providing a high level of flexibility in connecting computer workstations and by eliminating connection delays.The Library is very enthusiastic about the Office Automation Project, which the Library joined in February. We feel that the CS is providing great support.  We look forward to its benefits of computerization.The HELP Center courses attended by Library staff were useful and well taught.The Global Computer Applications menu is a very good idea, improving considerably VIC staff awareness of information resources available through the Central Computer.ADS1/ISIS software developed by CS/UNIDO has opened new horizons for wide distribution of VIC Library information through the VIC in a user friendly way.  ADS1/ISIS is a powerful system, but its users need system documentation badly.Some problems:-The problems with VSAM datasets and disk head crashes created serious problems for library services including loss of data.  Adjustment of the Computer Section record-keeping structure is needed to be able to differentiate between costs incurred through Computer Section error or malfunction and those normal library operating costs.-The mainframe response time sometimes is poor and creates inconveniences in Library services/staff work.-We experience problems with use of TSO/SCRIPT.  The old setup has not worked since the 4th quarter of 1988. Inadequate instructions were received on the use of the new version of SCRIPT.-Delays in delivery of some components for the Library's PS/2s (mouse,manuals) caused some inconveniences.†1                                                                     Suggestions:We suggest that the Computer Section consider conducting USER MEETINGS (e.g. in one of Conference rooms in C07) on a regular basis in order:-To inform users about general trends in computerization and steps/programs launched in the CS;-To provide recent news of in-house computer services with comments, explanation of problems encountered (if needed);
